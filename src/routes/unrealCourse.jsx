                        While working at ProbablyMonsters I wanted to gain as much experience with Unreal as possible.
                        My goal is to one day work as a Gameplay Engineer and the only way I'll be able to do that is by completing a bunch of side projects.
                        The course contained about 30 hours of videos, many of which contained challenges that I would have to complete on my own.
                        Each section built on the previous one beginning with a simple physics game and ending with a small 3rd person shooter.

                        Blueprints, animations, effects, and audio were covered. 
                        The main focus of the course was on using C++ with Unreal.
                        After getting used to the workflow, I realized that C++ really isn't too different from C# and I feel pretty comfortable solving problems with it.
                        The most challenging part was figuring out the Unreal specific syntax.

                    My favorite project was setting up a crypt complete with lighting and a few puzzles for the player to solve.
                    I'm planning on coming back to the crypt I made so I can use it in a decent sized portfolio project.

                        I also had the chance to make a 3rd person platformer with a variety of obstacles that knock the player off like Wipe Outâ„¢.
                        You can also see a screenshot below of the tank game I made where the player goes through a small maze and fights with some turrets.
